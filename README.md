# jest-vue-demo

packages we need for doing unit testing
```
npm i -D jest @vue/test-utils vue-jest babel-jest node-sass sass-loader jest-serializer-vue flush-promises

@vue/test-utils makes mounting new components lot easier, and have some helper methods

jest-serializer-vue for creating snap shot tests

flush-promises flush resolved promises which are no longer needed
